## Description
This is an application that is user interactive that tracks using JavaScript what kind of a triangle the lengths inserted on the text box can form. The lengths may form an equilateral triangle- a triangle where all sides are equal or an isosceles triangle- a triangle who's two sides are equal or a scalene triangle- a triangle who's sides are not equal or maybe the lengths may not form a triangle. This is when the sum of any two sides is less than the third one.
